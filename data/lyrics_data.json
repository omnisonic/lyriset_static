  "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park": {
    "artist": "Tom Lehrer",
    "lyrics": "I'd like to take you now on wings of song as it were,\nand try and help you forget, perhaps, for a while,\nyour drab wretched lives.\nHere is a song all about springtime in general,\nand in particular about one of the many delightful\npastimes that the coming of spring affords us all:\n\nSpring is here\nA-suh-puh-ring is here\nLife is skittles and life is beer\nI think the loveliest time\nOf the year is the spring\nI do, don't you? 'Course you do\nBut there's one thing\nThat makes spring complete for me\nAnd makes every Sunday\nA treat for me\n\nAll the world seems in tune\nOn a spring afternoon\nWhen we're poisoning pigeons in the park\nEvery Sunday you'll see\nMy sweetheart and me\nAs we poison the pigeons in the park\n\nWhen they see us coming\nThe birdies all try an' hide\nBut they still go for peanuts\nWhen coated with cyanide\nThe sun's shining bright\nEverything seems all right\nWhen we're poisoning pigeons in the park\n\nWe've gained notoriety\nAnd caused much anxiety\nIn the Audubon Society\nWith our games\nThey call it impiety\nAnd lack of propriety\nAnd quite a variety\nOf unpleasant names\nBut it's not against any religion\nTo want to dispose of a pigeon\n\nSo if Sunday you're free\nWhy don't you come with me\nAnd we'll poison the pigeons in the park\nAnd maybe we'll do\nIn a squirrel or two\nWhile we're poisoning pigeons in the park\n\nWe'll murder them all\nAmid laughter and merriment\nExcept for the few\nWe take home to experiment\nMy pulse will be quickenin'\nWith each drop of strych'nine\nWe feed to a pigeon\nTo poison a pigeon in the park"

  "Who's Next?": {
    "artist": "Tom Lehrer",
    "lyrics": "First we got the bomb and that was good,\n'Cause we love peace and motherhood.\nThen Russia got the bomb, but that's O.K.,\n'Cause the balance of power's maintained that way!\nWho's next?\n\nFrance got the bomb, but don't you grieve,\n'Cause they're on our side, I believe.\nChina got the bomb, but have no fears;\nThey can't wipe us out for at least five years!\nWho's next?\n\nThen Indonesia claimed that they\nWere gonna get one any day.\nSouth Africa wants two, that's right:\nOne for the black and one for the white!\nWho's next?\n\nEgypt's gonna get one, too,\nJust to use on you know who.\nSo Israel's getting tense,\nWants one in self defense.\n\"The Lord's our shepherd,\" says the psalm,\nBut just in case, we better get a bomb!\nWho's next?\n\nLuxembourg is next to go\nAnd, who knows, maybe Monaco.\nWe'll try to stay serene and calm\nWhen Alabama gets the bomb!\nWho's next, who's next, who's next?\nWho's next?"
